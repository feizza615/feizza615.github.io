        <h2>This past January, I worked with two of my classmates to create a game/timer application. We used React Native, Node JS, and Expo to create an IOS/Android app to help students overcome procrastination and manage their study time.  <a style="color:gray; font-size: medium;" href = "https://github.com/feizza615/winter-2021-codefest-submissions-bug-busters" target = "_self"><h2>You can take a look at our app here.</h2></a></h2>
        <h2>Last October, I attended my first virtual hackathon where I worked in a team of four to visualize raw data on censorship through Tableau and to analyze how social media,
          health, and news sites are treated by censors internationally. Our project won the “Best Digital Forensic Related Hack.” <a style="color:gray; font-size: medium;"href = "https://devpost.com/software/detecting-internet-censorship" target = "_self" "><h2>You can take a look at our presentation here.</h2></a></h2>

        <h2>Outside of CS, I enjoy cooking everything from traditional Bangladeshi dishes to grilled chicken sandwhiches. I also love creating henna designs and doing henna for all of my younger cousins. Lastly, I enjoy traveling when I can (I've been to six countries so far)! </h2>
